///
/// Beats-per-minute (BPM) detection routine.
///
/// The beat detection algorithm works as follows:
/// - Use function 'inputSamples' to input a chunks of samples to the class for
///   analysis. It's a good idea to enter a large sound file or stream in smallish
///   chunks of around few kilosamples in order not to extinguish too much RAM memory.
/// - Input sound data is decimated to approx 500 Hz to reduce calculation burden,
///   which is basically ok as low (bass) frequencies mostly determine the beat rate.
///   Simple averaging is used for anti-alias filtering because the resulting signal
///   quality isn't of that high importance.
/// - Decimated sound data is enveloped, i.e. the amplitude shape is detected by
///   taking absolute value that's smoothed by sliding average. Signal levels that
///   are below a couple of times the general RMS amplitude level are cut away to
///   leave only notable peaks there.
/// - Repeating sound patterns (e.g. beats) are detected by calculating short-term 
///   autocorrelation function of the enveloped signal.
/// - After whole sound data file has been analyzed as above, the bpm level is 
///   detected by function 'getBpm' that finds the highest peak of the autocorrelation 
///   function, calculates it's precise location and converts this reading to bpm's.
