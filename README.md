Compiled and tested on OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite with Xcode 7.1, openFrameworks 0.8.4 (**2015.11.20**)

#### TODO
- to add a flag to indicate if the detector has enough audio samples to estimate BPM or not.
- to add a function to clear and reset detection process.
- to handle continuously changing BPM in a better way.
